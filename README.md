This project implements the Markowitz Mean-Variance Model to optimize a portfolio of assets. 
The model uses historical returns data to calculate expected returns, risk (covariance and correlation), and the optimal allocation weights that minimize risk while maximizing returns.


-Applied advanced statistical techniques, including covariance and correlation matrices, to assess the co-movements and relationships between two assets' returns

-Computed portfolio variance and Sharpe ratio for two-asset combinations, evaluating risk-adjusted returns and performance relative to the risk-free rate

-Utilized Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory to optimize the Sharpe ratio, seeking the highest return-to-risk ratio in two-asset portfolio scenarios through mean-variance optimization

-Delved into the efficient frontier concept, examining its role in identifying optimal portfolios and shaping asset allocation strategies for improved risk management and return maximization
