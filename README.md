This project focuses on the implementation of the Markowitz Mean-Variance Model to optimize a portfolio comprising multiple assets. By using historical returns data, the model enables the accurate calculation of key metrics, such as expected returns and risk, represented by covariance and correlation. 
These metrics form the foundation for informed investment decisions and are essential in determining the optimal allocation weights that minimize the overall portfolio risk, while maximizing expected returns.



-Applied advanced statistical techniques, including covariance and correlation matrices, to assess the co-movements and relationships between two assets' returns

-Computed portfolio variance and Sharpe ratio for two-asset combinations, evaluating risk-adjusted returns and performance relative to the risk-free rate

-Utilized Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory to optimize the Sharpe ratio, seeking the highest return-to-risk ratio in two-asset portfolio scenarios through mean-variance optimization

-Delved into the efficient frontier concept, examining its role in identifying optimal portfolios and shaping asset allocation strategies for improved risk management and return maximization
